Real-Time Collaborative Code Learning Platform. This repository contains the code for an online coding web application created for Tom to mentor Josh remotely in JavaScript. The application features a lobby page where users can choose from a list of code blocks, each representing a coding exercise. Upon selecting a code block, users are taken to a dedicated code block page where the mentor can observe code changes in real-time while the student interacts with the code. The mentor sees the code block in read-only mode, while the student can modify the code. The application utilizes socket technology for real-time code updates and integrates Highlight.js for syntax highlighting. Code blocks are manually created and stored in a database. Feel free to explore the code and contribute to its development!
